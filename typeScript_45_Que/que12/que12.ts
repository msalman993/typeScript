//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[] = ["Muhammad Shaqib", "Sami Ullah", "Asad Kurram", "Muhammad Hasnain"];
for (let name of names) {
    console.log(`I will feel happy if you start programming Dear ${name}`)
}
